<p> shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. They are often worn with a sock. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with form originally being tied to function. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes protect against. Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots which are required footwear at industrial worksites.</p>

<p> Nike's scale is a big advantage, adidas doesn't even come close. adidas looks cheaper than Nike and has been a better growth story, but there is a reason for Nike's high valuation. Nike is better managed than adidas and has a stronger brand.</p>

<h4>Nike is an American multinational company that is the world’s largest athletic shoes and apparel manufacturer and supplier. Originally known as “Blue Ribbon Sports” it was founded by Bill Bowerman and Phill Knight who was a track athlete in 1964 before becoming Nike in 1971. The name was taken from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. The company was first made as a distributor for a Japanese shoemaker Onitsuka Tiger. Bowerman then made his first shoe for Otis Davis who later went on to win two Olympic gold medals in 1960.</h4>

<p id="pp">Nike is a leading sports apparel manufacturer ruling the industry for some decades now. The main focus of Nike has been an aggressive approach towards building strong and promising networks and partnerships with celebrity athletes. To quote an example is to mention the exclusive contract that the company bagged with Michael Jordan when the latter signed it in 1984. This grew to be one of the most iconic partnerships in the sportswear industry and has benefitted both of them. On one hand, Michael Jordan witnessed tremendous growth in his net worth, and on the other hand, it gave Nike a lead and a total monopoly in the basketball sneaker business. Besides, it also helped increase the overall demand for common stock ownerships.</p>
